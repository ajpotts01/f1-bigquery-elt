# f1-bigquery-elt
F1 BigQuery ELT project.

The transformations for this project were inspired by a Databricks project I was creating while following the [excellent course by Ramesh Retnasamy on Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/course/azure-databricks-spark-core-for-data-engineer).

I originally started this in my own Databricks workspace, but given my work is taking me further and further into the GCP ecosystem, I decided to do this as a dbt project.

Dataform was considered, but it doesn't like monorepos, so that's on the backburner for now.

Work in progress. I may come back one day and continue this for Databricks but not right now.
